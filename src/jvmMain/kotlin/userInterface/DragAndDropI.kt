/*
The following three composable functions draggable, dragTarget and dropTarget work together
to implement the dragging and dropping of elements onto the work space.  dropTarget function
also contains the code for drawing the bond arrows.  I found these functions in an article
on the internet.  They were very general purpose.  They have been specialized to make them
easier to use in this program and enhanced to provide functionality needed for this program.

They communicate with each other by accessing variables in an instance of CompositionalLocal.

draggable is basically a box that is capable of dragging any given composable over what ever
contents are displayed in the box.  At the least, the contents need to include at least one
dragTarget and dropTarget.

The contents to display are passed in as composable parameter.  In our case this is almost
all the ui minus the popup results window.

The composable to drag is provided by the dragTarget function, which in our case is just a
short Text().  The drag animation is accomplished by placing the composable in another box
that uses a .graphicsLayer modifier to translate its coordinates. A stream of coordinates is
provided by the dragTarget function.
 */

@Composable
fun draggable(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    content: @Composable BoxScope.() -> Unit  //Content to display
) {
    val state = LocalStateInfo.current
    var localOffsetToWindow by remember { mutableStateOf(Offset.Zero)}

    Box(modifier = modifier
        .fillMaxSize()
        .onGloballyPositioned {
            localOffsetToWindow = it.localToWindow(Offset.Zero)
        }
    )
    {
        content()
        if (state.isDragging) {
            // dragTarget function says to start dragging whatever it has placed
            // in the draggableComposable variable.
            var targetSize by remember {
                mutableStateOf(IntSize.Zero)
            }
            Box(modifier = Modifier
                .graphicsLayer {
                    val offset = (state.startPosition + state.dragOffset)
                    translationX = offset.x.minus(targetSize.width / 2) - localOffsetToWindow.x
                    translationY = offset.y.minus(targetSize.height / 2) - localOffsetToWindow.y
                }
                .onGloballyPositioned {
                    targetSize = it.size
                }
            ) {

                state.draggableComposable?.invoke()
            }
        }
    }
}

/*
The idea behind dragTarget is to pass in composable content, display it and
make it draggable. It does this by displaying the content in a box that uses a
.pointer modifier to look for drag events.  When the box sees a onDragStart event
it crates another composable that we want to see dragged around. It stores
this new composable in the draggableComposable variable and sets isDragging variable
to true.  This notifies the draggable function that it is time to start positioning
the composable based on the position data that this function will provide by
processing onDrag events.

It also stores data in the dataToDrop variable that can be used by the dropTarget
function once dragging is complete.

Several things to note:
1. Calls to dragTarget must be place in the scope of a draggable function.
2. The content being dragged is not the content being displayed.  It is
   content created on the fly when an onDragStart event is processed. In
   our case it looks the same as our displayed content, a short String.
3. We only process drag events if we are in element mode, not while
   we are dragging bond arrows.

This is how to use this function. Say you have some content you want to be
draggable.  Instead of placing the content directly in a composable say a row
or a column, place a dragTarget there instead and then place your content in the
dragTarget.  Remember you dragTarget must also be in a draggable.  Usually
the row or column etc. will already be in a draggable.

This function has been enhanced to check of doubleTap events which are a
signal from the user to delete this element from the bond graph.

/*
The original main purpose of dropTarget was to handle things after a drag is
completed.  In the original program there were several dropTargets. Each would
check if the dragged composable was withing its layout bounds, and if it was
it would store and tally information stored in dataToDrop variable.

In this program there is only one dropTarget, the work pane where we are drawing
the bond graph.  We want the text currently being shown by the draggable composable
to remain on the screen where it is dropped. So we must either create a new element
and add it to the bond graph, or we must update the position information if an
existing element was moved.

In addition, this function handles all the drawing of the bonds, from creating them by
dragging them, to updating them when they need to be changed.  Unlike the elements in
the graph which are each displayed by their own function, all the bonds are drawn
by this function.  It does this using modifiers to detect various tap and drag
gestures and then uses .drawWithCache modifier to do the graphics.  When this function
detects a gesture it must search to see is there is a bond or element near the gesture.
